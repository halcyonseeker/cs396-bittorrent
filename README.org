#+TITLE: Bitclient: A Simple BitTorrent Client

* Building
** The Broken C Version
   1. Download and build [[https://github.com/cwyang/bencode][this bencode library]]. (=git submodule init;
      cd bencode; make=).
   2. In the unlikely event that it isn't pre-installed, install
      [[https://curl.se/libcurl/][libcurl]].
   3. To build the program just run =make=.

** The Boring But Working LibTorrent Version
   1. Install [[https://libtorrent.org][LibTorrent]]. Weirdly, on Arch GNU/Linux the libtorrent
      package didn't contain the C++ header files, so I had to install
      the libtorrent-rasterbar package. I believe it depends on Boost.
   2. Just run =make= in the lt/ directory.
